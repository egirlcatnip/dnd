## Appearance

```
Lean, agile build, surprisingly tall.
Naturally brown, now white bleached hair, with roots starting to show through, falling down to her shoulders.
Always messy and getting in the way, but with refusal to keep them shorter.
Her tusks escaping her closed mouth and shining every time she grins.
Bright, lavender-gray eyes.
Lengthy, gentle fingers with nails kept long and sharp.
Almost always seen with a cloak over her head.
Pointy ears decorated with earrings.
```

## Personality

### Backstory

```
Born to a mother she never knew and raised by a harsh orc father, she grew to
resent his unyielding expectations. Among her peers, she hid her discomfort to
protect both flesh and soul. Though both tiefling and orc, her tusks remained a
stark reminder of what she wished to leave behind. Unable to fully escape her
heritage, she fled home with a bow, a dagger, and a cloak, seeking freedom in
Itharis.
```

### Personality Traits

Friendly, but distant when it comes to personal matters.

### Ideals

Freedom Seeks to define own path, away from father’s expectations.

### Bonds

Her bow and dagger represent her escape; she never parts with them.

### Flaws

Struggles to accept her orc heritage, leading to moments of self-doubt.

Silly demeanour. Doesn't show weak side. Playful, but distant in personal
topics.
